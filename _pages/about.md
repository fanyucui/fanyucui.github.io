I am a Ph.D. Student in the Biostatistics Department at Columbia University. Prior to this, I was fortunate to be advised by [Carlos Cinelli](https://carloscinelli.com/) and received my M.S. in Statistics at the University of Washington, Seattle. I was also fortunate to be mentored by Kimberly Sellers and earned my B.A. in Mathematics and Economics at Georgetown University.
