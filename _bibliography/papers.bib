  title={A flexible univariate moving average time-series model for dispersed count data},
  author={Sellers, Kimberly F and Arab, Ali and Melville, Sean and Cui, Fanyu},
  abstract={Al-Osh and Alzaid (1988) consider a Poisson moving average (PMA) model to describe the relation among integer-valued time series data; this model, however, is constrained by the underlying equi-dispersion assumption for count data (i.e., that the variance and the mean equal). This work instead introduces a flexible integer-valued moving average model for count data that contain over- or under-dispersion via the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution and related distributions. This first-order sum-of-Conway-Maxwell-Poissons moving average (SCMPMA(1)) model offers a generalizable construct that includes the PMA (among others) as a special case. We highlight the SCMPMA model properties and illustrate its flexibility via simulated data examples.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
